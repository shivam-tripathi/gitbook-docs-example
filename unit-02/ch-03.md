# Coming from MusicBrainz

This page describes the key differences between the BookBrainz and MusicBrainz schemas, for developers already familiar with the MusicBrainz schema.

## Entity Base Object
In BookBrainz, there is an “Entity” base object. What this means is that all entities share some common data, and store this data in a single table in the database. This greatly simplifies the rest of the database compared to MusicBrainz - instead of having a set of tables defined for each type of entity, we only need a single set of tables referencing the base table for entities.

The following fields are stored in the base table:

* gid
* master_revision_id
* last_updated
