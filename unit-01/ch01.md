# About BookBrainz

BookBrainz is an online encyclopaedia which contains information about published literature. Our aim is to collect and store data about every book, magazine, journal or other publication ever written.

BookBrainz is developed by just a small team of volunteers, unlike the [MusicBrainz encyclopaedia](http://musicbrainz.org/) on which it is based. Nevertheless, we are committed to making BookBrainz the definitive source of publication metadata. We hope to attract many contributors, who will be able to use their knowledge of literature to expand the database through our website. If you think you can help, [become a BookBrainz editor](https://bookbrainz.org/register)!
