# How We Operate
The core components of BookBrainz are the site, the webservice and the database. All of these components are running on MetaBrainz’s Sakura server, which also runs [CritiqueBrainz](https://critiquebrainz.org/).
BookBrainz relies on contributions from editors to expand the knowledge contained in the database. Editors can add new data to the site, fix any errors in the existing information, and create links between pieces of information. To acknowledge this vital input, we make our data freely available to everyone, for any use. While we don’t create regular database dumps at this early stage of the project, you’re welcome to browse the site or use the webservice to access data.
